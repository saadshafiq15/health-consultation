# AI Health Consultation System

# **ngrok Usage**
### **Purpose:** Development tunnel for Twilio webhook testing

**ngrok** is used to create a secure tunnel to localhost for:
1. Testing Twilio webhooks in development.
2. Allowing Twilio to reach the local server.
3. Real-time phone call handling during development.

### **Setup Steps:**
```
npm install -g ngrok
npm run dev
ngrok http 3000
```
Use the generated **HTTPS URL** in Twilio webhook configuration.

### **Environment Variable for Production:**
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_SERVER_URL=your_production_url_or_ngrok_url
```
**Note:** ngrok is only needed for development; use an actual server URL in production.

Classification Model

We used Classification Model in Python to determine potential diseases based on user-reported symptoms.

Setup and Execution:

Navigate to the model directory.

Create a virtual environment:

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # For macOS/Linux
venv\Scripts\activate  # For Windows

Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Run the model:

python app.py

Training the Model

The model is trained using a Jupyter Notebook file that contains datasets and training logic.

Data preprocessing, feature extraction, and classification techniques are implemented within the notebook.
